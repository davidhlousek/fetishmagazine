            <h1> “What Bistro Bastardo is?</h1>
            <p> Already at high school, Tomas Kundera fell in love with Mexican cuisine

                “ All the flavours, I straight fell in love with it. And so that was basically. Yeah when, I got the first kick to stay in touch with it(Mexican cuisine). Then I tried more and more. The more I tried, the more I wanted it. It’s just that, I was hooked!” - Tomas
                
                
                Back in 2007 was the first time Tomas had an idea about establishing a place like Bistro Bastardo. It was a dream that he would’ve liked to accomplish, but back then, it was still a long journey. It was an entire decade before he could make his dream come true.  
                
                2017>>
                The renovation of Svobody started, and they did not have a chef yet.
                Then they crossed paths with Ale(Alejandro Roa), but he was still in Mexico…
                Tomas and David (David Reschoský), co-owners of Bistro Bastardo were sweating it out, delaying the opening by 2 months. Still paying rent (At the branch on Náměstí Svobody) with whatever they got left in their pockets as Ale’s visa took a while to get granted to him.





                                    “ FEAR NO MORE! ALE HAS ARRIVED”







                                                          THEN FINALLY (IN 2017), BISTRO BASTARDO                               OFFICIALLY OPENS. ITS A SUCCESS RIGHT FROM DAY 1!



   Ale, Tomas and David however battle it out 8 long excruciating months, 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. All by themselves…
