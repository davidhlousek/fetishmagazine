            <h1>What is FETISH?</h1>
            <p>“The magazine “Fetish” represents an effort to delve deeper into various aspects of fetish and fetishism through systematic research and discussions on the definition of fetishes. My approach focuses on individual perspectives, where each subject approaches the topic from their own experiential standpoint. Some regard fetishism as merely a sexual preference, while others favor a theory that interprets fetishes as rituals. Overview. I discuss the consciousness or unconsciousness of fetishes, emphasizing that eliminating one fetish may give rise to new ones. Each individual has a unique view of fetishes and creates their own definition of this phenomenon. In the introductory part of the magazine, I aim to familiarize readers with the issues surrounding fetish and subsequently reflect on various perspectives that may exist.“The magazine “Fetish” represents an effort to delve deeper into various aspects of fetish and fetishism through systematic research and discussions on the definition of fetishes.

            <p>At times, a fetish is perceived as a relationship with material objects. My personal belief is that every form of fetish has its legitimacy, and my effort is to identify those that resonate with me the most. The magazine “Fetish” serves as a means to raise awareness that fetish/fetishism does not solely encompass sexual expressions. Instead, it is a complex topic that is often taboo in Czech society.”</p>
